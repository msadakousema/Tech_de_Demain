		<li><b>What is Frontend Development?</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Frontend development refers to everything that users see and interact with on a website.</br> 
	Itâ€™s the part of web development responsible for the structure, design, behavior, and content of everything users experience in the browser.</br> 
	A good frontend is visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive to different devices.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Key Technologies Used in Frontend Development:</b></li>
		<p>1 . HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</br>
		HTML is the backbone of any webpage. It defines the structure of the web page with elements like headers, paragraphs, links, images, and forms. Without HTML, there would be no content to display.</p>
		<p>2 . (ascading Style Sheets):</br>
		CSS is used to style and design the HTML elements. It controls the layout, colors, fonts,</br> and overall appearance of the webpage. CSS allows for creative and responsive designs that adjust based on the device (mobile, tablet, desktop).</p>
		<p>3 . JavaScript:</br>
		JavaScript is the language that adds interactivity and dynamic features to websites. It is used for tasks like form validation, animations, image sliders, and creating interactive maps. </br>Without JavaScript, websites would be static and not very engaging.</p>
		<li><b>Frontend Frameworks and Libraries:</b></li>
		<p>1 . Bootstrap:</br>
A popular framework that helps create responsive web pages quickly by using predefined CSS and JavaScript components.</br>
2 . React.js:</br>
A JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially single-page applications. It makes the development process more efficient by breaking the UI into reusable components.</br>
3 . Vue.js:</br>
A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It is easy to integrate into projects and provides reactive data-binding for smooth and efficient updates.</br>
4 . Responsive Web Design: </br>
Responsive web design ensures that the website adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., smartphones, tablets, and desktops). Using CSS media queries, a website can change its layout based on the screen size.
