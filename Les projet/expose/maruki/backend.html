		<li><b>What is Backend Development?</b></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Backend development is responsible for the server-side operations of a website. It manages the logic, database interactions, and server communication that powers the frontend. Without the backend, the website would not be able to store or retrieve data, manage users, or handle business logic.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Key Technologies in Backend Development:
	</b></li>
	<p>1 . Node.js:</br>
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to use JavaScript for server-side programming. It is fast, scalable, and ideal for real-time applications like chat apps.</br>
2 . Express.js:
A lightweight web application framework for Node.js, Express.js simplifies routing and middleware functions, making it easier to build web applications.</br>
3 . python (with Django/Flask):
Python is another popular backend language. Django is a high-level Python framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Flask is a micro-framework for small applications.</br>
4 . PHP:
PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language for building dynamic web applications. Itâ€™s particularly useful for content management systems like WordPress.</br>
5 . Ruby on Rails:
Ruby on Rails is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby, known for its simplicity and speed of development.</br>
6 . Databases:
Relational Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL):
Relational databases store data in structured tables and are ideal for websites that require complex queries, such as e-commerce sites.</br>
NoSQL Databases (MongoDB):
NoSQL databases store data in flexible, non-tabular formats like JSON. MongoDB is an example of a NoSQL database and is commonly used in web apps with fast-changing data.
API (Application Programming Interface): "Backend development often includes building APIs. APIs are interfaces that allow the frontend to communicate with the backend. RESTful APIs and GraphQL are common API styles used in modern web development.</p>
